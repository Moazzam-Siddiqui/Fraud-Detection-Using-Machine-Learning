üïµÔ∏è Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for fraud detection using multiple classification algorithms. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions by preprocessing the dataset, applying various models, and evaluating their performance with standard metrics.

üìå Features

Data preprocessing: Label Encoding, Scaling, Train-Test Split

Implemented multiple ML algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC Curve, AUC

Clear comparison of model performance
